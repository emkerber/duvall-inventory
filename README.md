# The Duvall Inventory

The Duvall Inventory is a yet-to-be-published and also very groundbreaking system for assessing and quantifying individuals' likability.

Users will be presented a series of questions, and after responding to each question, the user's likability - the degree to which the user's peers enjoy/admire/value the user - will be displayed as a number.

This app was generated from a starting repo owned by Prime Digital Academy.
